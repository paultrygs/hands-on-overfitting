# Hands-on Overfitting

**This learning material was developed for a coding event at Bouvet Norge.**


This repository contains two primary sections:

1. ``hands_on_demo.ipynb``: An interactive demo to learn about overfitting using simple models that are easy to visualize.
2. ``exercise.ipynb``: A coding exercise that complements the material from part 1.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have **Python 3.11** installed.


To setup the project on a UNIX system:

- Navigate to the project root directory.
- Run the following commands:

````bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry
poetry install
````
