# Hands-on Overfitting

**This learning material was developed for a coding event at Bouvet Norge.**


This repository contains two primary sections:

1. ``hands_on_demo.ipynb``: An interactive demo to learn about overfitting using simple models that are easy to visualize.
2. ``exercise.ipynb``: A coding exercise that complements the material from part 1.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have **Python 3.11** installed.


To setup the project on a UNIX system:

- Navigate to the project root directory.
- Run the following commands:

````bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry
poetry install
````

To set up on and use in a Windows system:

The easiest way is probably to install a WinPython distribution including python 3.11 and jupyter notebooks. 

This version is tested to work with demo and exercise: https://github.com/winpython/winpython/releases/tag/7.0.20231126final

- Download Winpython and extract to a folder of your choice
- Open folder and run WinPython Command Prompt.exe
- navigate to your github folder with the exercise by writing "cd C:\[....]\GitHub\hands-on-overfitting"
- write "jupyter notebook" to start notebooks. Select the notebook in the browser window opening
