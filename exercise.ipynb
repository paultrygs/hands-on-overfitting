    "## Exercise: Digit Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will work with a dataset that includes 8x8 greyscale images. Each image in the dataset represents a single digit ranging from 0-9, and contains an integer label indicating the depicted digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main task is to experiment with different models for recognizing or predicting digits in 8x8 greyscale images. Your task here is to classify the images based on the digit depicted in each image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of is to answer three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find examples of:\n",
    "    - Underfitting\n",
    "    - Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In your personal opinion, what do you think is the best possible model to train in this case? Why do you think it is the best model?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How large or complex do you think the model needs to be to get the best results?\n",

    "1. Use your favorite Machine Learning library.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `PolynomialClassifier`: \n",
    "    - Separates space into different regions using polynomials.\n",

    "A low-dimensional illustration of this method can be seen below:\n",
